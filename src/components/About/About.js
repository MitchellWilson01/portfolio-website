            <div className="outter"> 
                <p>Hi! My name is Mitchell and I'm a software developer. I love to 
                code and am particularly interested in creating responsive 
                applications. I have been coding for many years and have accrued 
                a lot of programming knowledge about all sorts of things. Professional 
                experience, formal education, and a genuine interest is what I bring 
                to the table in order to deliver top-notch software solutions.</p> 

                <p>I got my start by teaching myself to code while I began to study 
                accounting as an undergraduate. I quickly realized that software 
                development was the career path for me and I decided to study 
                computer science full time. Fast forward a few years and I have 
                earned my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.</p> 

                <p>Now I work as a full stack developer in Houston, TX and am 
                loving every bit of it. I am part of small team that works on 
                a couple different enterprise applications. My team and I work 
                to deliver new features, bug fixes, and fresh ideas that help to 
                make our software the best that it can be.</p> 

                <p>Outside of work I enjoy coding up new projects and learning about 
                new tools that I can use to continue improving upon my abilities. 
                I've even done some freelance work on the side for a local business. 
                When I need a break from coding I like to go to the gym, hangout 
                with my friends, and play video games.</p>
